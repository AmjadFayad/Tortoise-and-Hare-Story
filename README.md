A multi-threaded program to implement the tortoise and hare story.
This application simulates a race between two runners. The runners differ in their speed and how often they need to rest. One of the runners, named “Tortoise,” is slow but never rests. The other runner, named “Hare,” is 5 times as fast but rests at the mid of the way.
